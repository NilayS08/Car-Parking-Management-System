## üìù **Problem Statement**
Urban areas suffer from limited parking spaces and inefficient manual parking management. Traditional methods are prone to human error and lack real-time updates. This project introduces a **Smart Automated Parking System** using Arduino to streamline vehicle detection, space monitoring, and entry control, ensuring better space utilization and energy efficiency.

## üéØ **Objective**
To design a **compact, cost-effective Arduino-based parking solution** that:
- Detects approaching vehicles using an **IR sensor**
- Monitors two individual parking spots with **ultrasonic sensors**
- Displays real-time parking availability on an **LCD screen**
- Manages entry using a **status LED**
- Adjusts **LCD brightness based on ambient light** using an **LDR sensor** to conserve power

## üî© **Components Used**
| Component                   | Quantity |
|----------------------------|----------|
| Arduino Uno/Nano           | 1        |
| Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)| 2        |
| IR Sensor                  | 1        |
| Entry Status LED           | 1        |
| I2C 16x2 LCD Display       | 1        |
| LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) | 1   |
| Breadboard & Jumper Wires  | As needed |
| Power Source (USB/Battery) | 1        |

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
1. **Vehicle Detection (IR Sensor)**:  
   - Detects vehicles at the entrance.
   - If spots are available, allows entry using a green LED.
   - If full, the LED blinks to indicate no entry.

2. **Slot Monitoring (Ultrasonic Sensors)**:  
   - Two sensors are assigned to two parking spaces.
   - Measures distance to detect if a car is present (threshold: 15 cm).
   - Updates internal status for each slot.

3. **Ambient Light Detection (LDR Sensor)**:  
   - Detects if it's day or night.
   - Increases LCD brightness during the day.
   - Reduces brightness at night to **save power**.

4. **Entry LED**:  
   - Lights up for 3 seconds when entry is allowed.
   - Blinks continuously if the system is full.

5. **LCD Display**:  
   - Shows real-time availability:
     - Example: ‚ÄúAvailable: 1/2‚Äù
     - Slot status: ‚ÄúS1:Full S2:Free‚Äù
   - Refreshes every 500 milliseconds.

6. **System Flow Summary**:  
   - Detects incoming vehicle ‚Üí Checks space availability ‚Üí Updates LED and LCD ‚Üí Manages LCD brightness via LDR
